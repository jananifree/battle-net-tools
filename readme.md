What this project is
Battle-Net Tools is designed for Blizzard fans who want a unified experience. It blends social features from Battle.net with live game updates and cross-platform chat in a single surface. Users can connect to friends, monitor game updates, and receive notifications even if they switch between platforms. The tool is designed to be lightweight, fast, and dependable. It does not require deep system privileges. It aims to be easy to install, easy to run, and easy to understand.

The core idea is simple: bring together communication, updates, and social features from Blizzard games into one friendly package. The project chooses clear defaults, straightforward configuration, and sensible defaults for performance and privacy. It treats user data with care and focuses on delivering value without complexity. It is designed for long sessions, late-night players, and busy gamers who want to stay in the loop.

Core features
- Cross-Platform Chat: Send and receive messages with friends across Windows, macOS, and Linux without friction.
- Social Features: See which friends are online, who is playing which Blizzard title, and how your social graph is evolving.
- Game Updates: Get notified about patches, hotfixes, and seasonal events. See patch notes and important changes in one place.
- Unified Interface: One window for chat, friends list, and updates. Fewer apps to manage means less distraction.
- Lightweight Footprint: Uses a small memory footprint and a clean UI so it runs well on older machines.
- Localized UI: Basic localization support to help non-English users understand the interface easily.
- Extensible Architecture: A modular structure that makes it easier to add features in the future.

How it works
- The tool communicates with Blizzard’s services to fetch social data and game update notices.
- It uses a minimal, dependency-light runtime to keep performance snappy.
- The UI is built to be responsive on desktop displays, with scalable text and clear contrast for readability.
- On start, the app checks for updates and then connects to your Blizzard account to fetch your friend list and status.
- It then pulls the latest patch notes for supported Blizzard games and surfaces them in the updates panel.
- When new messages arrive or statuses change, notifications are shown in the system tray area, if enabled.

Getting started
- Prerequisites: A working desktop environment, a stable internet connection, and basic familiarity with installing software on your OS.
- Licensing: The project uses an open license to encourage collaboration. See the License section for specifics.
